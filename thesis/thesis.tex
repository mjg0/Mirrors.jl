\section{The Problem} \label{sec:problem}

We don't have good models of how roughness affects reflectance (CITE). There's stuff that does well when the roughness is a lot bigger or smaller than the wavelength of incident light (CITE both); this is meant to fit between.

\section{The Attempted Solution} \label{sec:attempted_solution}

Made a computational model for circular rough mirrors. It's available on \href{https://github.com/mjg0/Mirrors.jl}{GitHub}.



\chapter{The Math} \label{chap:math}

\section{Expected Results} \label{sec:expected_results}

We need to make sure that our results make sense--does our program predict correct reflectance even for a flat mirror? So we need to figure out an equation that gives us what we expect: given an incident angle, $\alpha$, how would an ideal mirror react? In the far field, what is the intesity (as predicted by physical optics) at a certain polar and azimuthal angle?

\subsection{Huygens Approximation} \label{subsec:huygens_approx}

We obviously need an expected reflectance profile to make sure that what we're doing looks right. Since a flat, finite, perfectly conductive mirror is just the reflective version of an aperture (CITE), we can use the Huygen-Fresnel principle to see how light should behave when it hits a perfectly flat, perfectly reflective mirror.

Unfortunately I couldn't find an equation for diffraction through a \textit{tilted} circular aperture so I had to figure it out myself. An easy test of what I found is ensuring that whatever I come up with is identical to the circular aperture diffraction when the light comes in normal to the mirror, which is proportional to (CITE):

\begin{equation}
  \frac{2\J_1(kR\sin(\theta))}{kR\sin(\theta)}
\end{equation}

\ldots where $k$ is the wave number, $\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}$ ($\lambda$ being the wavelength), $R$ is the radius of the aperture (mirror in our case), and $\theta$ is the angle at which the reflectance is measured. $J_1$ is the first order Bessel function of the first kind. This is the Airy pattern (CITE?).

\subsubsection{Setup}

The electric field on a flat mirror in the x-y plane due to a plane wave coming in at an angle $\alpha$ from normal (the z axis), inclined toward the x axis, is proportional to (CITE?):

\begin{equation}
  e^{ikx\sin\left({\alpha}\right)}
\end{equation}

The contribution of one point on the mirror to the far field reflectance at some polar angle $\theta$ and azimuthal angle $\phi$ is just going to be that exponential multiplied by some phase shift.

\subsubsection{Phase Shift}
Since we're concerned with reflectance in the far field, all we need to determine is the phase shift relative to the origin. For some point $p$, we need to calculate the distance $d$ between that point and the origin \textit{along the direction of travel toward the point in the far field} defined by $\theta$ and $\phi$.

\begin{figure}
  \centerline{\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{phase-length}}
  \caption[Phase length of a beam of light]{\label{fig:phase_length}
    $d$ is the phase shift of light coming from $p$ relative to light coming from the origin.}
\end{figure}

$d$ is given by dotting the unit vector $\hat{u}$ with $-\vec{p}$ \ref{fig:phase_length}. $\hat{u}$ is $\left(\sin{\theta}\cos{\phi},\sin{\theta}\sin{\phi},\cos{\theta}\right)$, so $d$ is:

\begin{equation}
  -x_p\sin{\theta}\cos{\phi}-y_p\sin{\theta}\sin{\phi}
\end{equation}

\ldots where $x_p$ and $y_p$ are the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of $p$.

The corresponding phase shift is thus:

\begin{equation}
  e^{-ik(x_p\sin{\theta}\cos{\phi}+y_p\sin{\theta}\sin{\phi})}
\end{equation}

\ldots so the contribution to the far field by a given point is:

\begin{equation}
  e^{ikx\sin\left({\alpha}\right)}e^{-ik(x_p\sin{\theta}\cos{\phi}+y_p\sin{\theta}\sin{\phi})}
\end{equation}

\ldots or:

\begin{equation}
  e^{ik\left(x_p(\sin{\alpha}-\sin{\theta}\cos{\phi})-y_p\sin{\theta}\sin{\phi}\right)}
\end{equation}

For simplicity, we'll define $a$ and $b$ as:

\begin{equation}
  a = k\left(\sin{\alpha}-\sin{\theta}\cos{\phi}\right)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  b = -k\sin{\theta}\sin{\phi}
\end{equation}

\ldots so that we can represent the contribution from $p$ the far field as:

\begin{equation}
  e^{i(ax_p+by_p)}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Integrating}
To find the total contribution to the far field from the entire mirror (of radius $R$) at some $\theta$ and $\phi$, we need to integrate this contribution over the entire surface:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:integral1}
  \int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^R e^{i(ar\cos(\Theta)+br\sin(\Theta))} rdrd\Theta
\end{equation}

\ldots where I subbed in $r\cos\Theta$ and $r\sin\Theta$ for $x$ and $y$ respectively.

Due to my weak math skills, I used Mathematica to integrate this~\ref{chap:integral}. Turns out the solution is:

\begin{equation}
  \pi R^2 \pFq{0}{1}{}{2}{-\frac{R^2}{4}\left(a^2+b^2\right)}
\end{equation}

\ldots where ${}_0 F_1$ is the confluent hypergeometric limit function. Subbing $a$ and $b$ back in appropriately, and using $\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}$ in $k$'s stead, we get:

\begin{equation}
  \pi R^2 \pFq{0}{1}{}{2}{-\frac{\pi^2 R^2}{\lambda^2}\left(\sin^2\alpha+\sin^2\theta-2\sin\alpha\sin\theta\cos\phi\right)}
\end{equation}
