\section{The Problem} \label{sec:problem}

Modeling reflectance from a conducting surface with roughness that's on the same order of size as the wavelength of incident light is hard \cite{Schroder2011}. The computational model provided here is meant to accurately predict such reflectance.



\section{The Attempted Solution} \label{sec:attempted_solution}

A \href{https://github.com/mjg0/Mirrors.jl}{Julia package} was written to calculate the far-field reflectance from a rough circular conducting mirror using the model in chapter \ref{chap:methods}. It is included as appendix \ref{chap:julia} and is available on GitHub at https://github.com/mjg0/Mirrors.jl.



\section{Note on Plots} \label{sec:plots_note}

Two types of plots will be used frequently here: plots of mirrors and plots of reflectance. Mirror plots are what one would expect: the mentioned parameter (e.g. height, electric field) is plotted on the shape of the mirror itself. Reflectance plots are \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azimuthal_equidistant_projection}{polar azimuthal equidistant projections} centered at normal to the mirror and extending to 90 degrees, much like a map of the northern hemisphere centered at the North Pole and extending to the equator, with the magnitude of reflected light corresponding to the intensity of the color.

\chapter{Methods} \label{chap:methods}

\section{Modeling Expected Results} \label{sec:expected_results}

It is vital to ensure that the program can correctly predict reflectance for a flat mirror--failing that, it cannot be trusted to predict reflectance for rough surfaces. An equation that can predict far-field reflectance for an ideal mirror given an incident beam angle is thus needed. Physical optics are used for simplicity.

\subsection{Huygens Approximation} \label{subsec:huygens_approx}

Since a finite, perfectly reflective surface is analogous to an aperture, the Huygens-Fresnel principle is used to approximate the behavior of circular mirrors. An easy test of the approximation is the result when light strikes from normal to the surface--it should be proportional to the Airy pattern:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:airy}
  \frac{\J_1(kR\sin(\theta))}{kR\sin(\theta)}
\end{equation}

\ldots where $k$ is the wave number, $R$ is the radius of the aperture (mirror in this case), and $\theta$ is the angle at which the reflectance is measured. $J_1$ is the first order Bessel function of the first kind.

\subsection{Setup} \label{sec:setup}

The electric field on a flat mirror in the x-y plane due to a plane wave incident at angle $\alpha$ from normal (the z axis), inclined toward the x axis, is proportional to:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:efield}
  e^{i\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}x\sin\left({\alpha}\right)}
\end{equation}

\ldots where $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the incident light. See figure \ref{fig:efield_at_angle}.

\begin{figure}
  \centerline{\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{efield-at-angle}}
  \caption[Plane wave incident on mirror surface at angle $\alpha$]{\label{fig:efield_at_angle}
    Illustration of a plane wave originating at angle $\alpha$ from normal (the z axis) striking a mirror's surface (the x axis). Two planes along which the real part of the electric field is zero are shown as blue lines, with a single wavelength ($\lambda$) separating them. At this moment in time, the electric field at any point on the mirror surface is given by equation \ref{eq:efield}.}
\end{figure}

The contribution of one point on the mirror to the far field reflectance at some polar angle $\theta$ and azimuthal angle $\phi$ is equation \ref{eq:efield} multiplied by some phase shift.

\subsection{Phase Shift} \label{sec:phase_shift}

The phase shift relative to the origin suffices since far-field reflectance is sought. For some point $p$, the distance $d$ between that point and the origin \textit{along the direction of travel toward the point in the far field} defined by $\theta$ and $\phi$ is needed.

\begin{figure}
  \centerline{\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{phase-length}}
  \caption[Phase length of a beam of light]{\label{fig:phase_length}
    $d$ is the phase shift of light coming from $p$ relative to light coming from the origin.}
\end{figure}

$d$ is given by dotting the unit vector $\hat{u}$ with $-\vec{p}$ (see figure \ref{fig:phase_length}). $\hat{u}$ is $\left(\sin{\theta}\cos{\phi},\sin{\theta}\sin{\phi},\cos{\theta}\right)$, so $d$ is:

\begin{equation}
  -x_p\sin{\theta}\cos{\phi}-y_p\sin{\theta}\sin{\phi}
\end{equation}

\ldots where $x_p$ and $y_p$ are the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of $p$.

The corresponding phase shift is thus:

\begin{equation}
  e^{-ik(x_p\sin{\theta}\cos{\phi}+y_p\sin{\theta}\sin{\phi})}
\end{equation}

\ldots so the contribution to the far field by a given point is:

\begin{equation}
  e^{ikx\sin\left({\alpha}\right)}e^{-ik(x_p\sin{\theta}\cos{\phi}+y_p\sin{\theta}\sin{\phi})}
\end{equation}

\ldots or:

\begin{equation}
  e^{ik\left(x_p(\sin{\alpha}-\sin{\theta}\cos{\phi})-y_p\sin{\theta}\sin{\phi}\right)}
\end{equation}

For simplicity, $a$ and $b$ are defined as:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:a}
  a = k\left(\sin{\alpha}-\sin{\theta}\cos{\phi}\right)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:b}
  b = -k\sin{\theta}\sin{\phi}
\end{equation}

\ldots so that the contribution from $p$ to the far field can be represented as:

\begin{equation}
  e^{i(ax_p+by_p)}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Integrating} \label{sec:integrating}

To find the total contribution to the far field from the entire mirror (of radius $R$) at some $\theta$ and $\phi$, this contribution must be integrated over the entire surface:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:integral1}
  \int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^R e^{i(ar\cos(\Theta)+br\sin(\Theta))} rdrd\Theta
\end{equation}

\ldots where $\Theta$ represents the angular coordinate of the mirror surface and $r\cos\Theta$ and $r\sin\Theta$ have been substituted for $x$ and $y$ respectively.

The solution (see appendix \ref{chap:integral}) is:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:expected_refl}
  \pi R^2 \pFq{0}{1}{}{2}{-\frac{R^2}{4}\left(a^2+b^2\right)}
\end{equation}

\ldots where ${}_0 F_1$ is the confluent hypergeometric limit function. Replacing $a$ and $b$ with equations \ref{eq:a} and \ref{eq:b} respectively, and using $\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}$ in $k$'s stead, gives:

\begin{equation}
  \pi R^2 \pFq{0}{1}{}{2}{-\frac{\pi^2 R^2}{\lambda^2}\left(\sin^2\alpha+\sin^2\theta-2\sin\alpha\sin\theta\cos\phi\right)}
\end{equation}

As a quick check, when $\alpha$ is 0 (indicating normal incident light), this is proportional to equation \ref{eq:airy} as it should be (see appendix \ref{chap:airy_validation}).

% MIRROR MODELING %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Mirror Modeling} \label{section:mirror_modeling}

The simulated mirror is a circle broken up into rings of equal annular width $a$, each broken into patches of equal area $\frac{\pi a^2}{3}$. The first ring is broken into 3 patches, the second into 9, etc.; ring $n$ has $6n+3$ patches, and a mirror of $N$ rings has $3N^2$ total patches. Each patch has four points placed at:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:point_r}
  r = a \left(\frac{2n+1}{2} \pm \frac{1}{2\sqrt{3}}\right)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:point_th}
  \theta = 2\pi \left(\frac{2m+1}{12n+6} \pm \frac{1}{\left(12n+6\right)\sqrt{3}}\right)
\end{equation}

\ldots where $n$ is the ring index (starting from 0 at the center of the mirror) and $m$ is the patch index (starting at 0 and going to $6n-2$). The height $z$ at each point varies based on the mirror's roughness. See figure \ref{fig:patches_points} for an illustration, and appendix \ref{chap:circular_integration} for the rationale behind this model.

This spacing was chosen since it gives a fourth-order error term (see appendix \ref{chap:circular_integration}).

\begin{figure}
  \centerline{\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{circular-grid-with-points}}
  \caption[Mirror patch boundaries and point locations]{\label{fig:patches_points}
    The patch boundaries and points of a mirror with 3 rings. Point locations are chosen according to equations \ref{eq:point_r} and \ref{eq:point_th}.}
\end{figure}



\section{Electric Field at Surface}\label{sec:efield}

At each of the points on the mirror the electric field is calculated as follows, assuming a plane wave of wavelength $\lambda$ incident at angle $\alpha$ from normal (direction of $z$) in the x-z plane:

\begin{equation}
  k_{x}=2\pi\lambda\sin\left(\alpha\right)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  k_{z}=-2\pi\lambda\cos\left(\alpha\right)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  E=e^{i\left(k_{x}x+k_{z}z\right)}
\end{equation}

See figure \ref{fig:efield_at_angle} and equation \ref{eq:efield}; the additional z portion comes from the fact that a non-ideal mirror may have some height.



\section{Impedance Matrix} \label{sec:impedance}

The impedance matrix is a square matrix that represents how each point on the mirror influences each other point when there is a current the mirror's surface. Its length along each axis is the number of points on the surface. There are two portions: the portion representing the interaction of each patch with itself, and the portion representing the interaction between different patches.

The portion of the matrix that represents the interaction of each patch with itself consists of the 4x4 blocks along the main diagonal--the "first" patch's influence on itself is represented by cells $1,1$ through $4,4$, the second patch's by cells $5,5$ through $8,8$, etc.

The rest of the cells in the matrix represent how each point, excepting points in the same patch, interacts with every other point. For example, cell $1,5$ represents how point 1 is influenced by point 5.

\subsection{Different patch} \label{sec:different_patch}

Since there's no chance of hitting a singularity when computing how two different patches interact, each non-singular interaction for points $i$ and $j$ can be calculated with:

\begin{equation}
  Z_{i,j}=\frac{\pi a}{12n_{j}+6}G\left(p_{i},p_{j}\right)r_{j}
\end{equation}

...where the first fraction is a Jacobian (see Circular Integration equation 22, appendix \ref{chap:circular_integration} ($r_{j}$ has replaced $a\left(n+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{2\sqrt{3}}\right)$) and $G$ is the Green's function).

\subsection{Same patch} \label{sec:same_patch}

This is harder due to the need to deal with singularities. In essence, each annular patch is transformed from an annular section into a square; that square is split into 4 triangles with a common vertex at one of the four points in the patch; each triangle is then stretched into a square, the common point going from a point to a line to reduce the order of the singularity (see Circular Integration section 5.3 in appendix \ref{chap:circular_integration}). For numerical convenience, the triangular portion is transformed into a square bounded by $(0,0)$ to $(1,1)$. Then a function of two variables, $u$ and $v$ below, can be integrated over this square (see Circular Integration sections 5.6 and 5.7 in appendix \ref{chap:circular_integration}):

\begin{equation}
  r\left(u,v\right)=B_{2,1}u+B_{2,2}uv\pm\frac{a}{2\sqrt{3}}+a\left(n+\frac{1}{2}\right)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  \theta\left(u,v\right)=\frac{2\pi}{a(6n+3)}\left(a\left(m+\frac{1}{2}\right)+B_{1,1}u+B_{1,2}uv\pm\frac{a}{2\sqrt{3}}\right)
\end{equation}

...where $B$ is a matrix that allows transformation between a triangular piece of an annular patch and a square. In all there are 16 $B$ matrices, for 4 points with 4 corresponding triangles each (see Circular Integration subsection 5.5.1 in appendix \ref{chap:circular_integration}).

It is easy enough to get a function of $u$ and $v$ from the function of $r$, $\theta$, and $z$ to be integrated:

\begin{equation}
  f\left(u,v\right)=f\left(r\left(u,v\right),\theta\left(u,v\right),z\left(r\left(u,v\right),\theta\left(u,v\right)\right)\right)
\end{equation}

For utility a transform function is defined, taking a point ($r$, $\theta$, and $z$, with associated $n$ and $p$) and a function of that point, and yielding a function of $u$ and $v$:

\begin{equation}
  T\left(f,p\right)=\left(u,v\right)\rightarrow r\left(u,v\right)f\left(u,v\right)
\end{equation}

With this transform function, the integral of a function $f$ over a patch for a certain point $p$ can be calculated:

\begin{equation}
  P\left(f,p\right)=\frac{2\pi}{a\left(6n+3\right)}\sum_{triangles}|det\left(B_{t}\right))|H\left(T\left(f,p\right)\right)_{0,0}^{1,1}
\end{equation}

\ldots where $H$ computes the integral of $T\left(f,p\right)$ over the unit square \cite{HCubature}.

The desired function is the Green's function of the point with another point:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:greens}
  G\left(p_{1},p_{2}\right)=\frac{e^{ik\rho}}{4\pi\rho}
\end{equation}

...where $k$ is the wave number and $\rho$ is the distance between the two points. The point to be integrated around can be fixed (since $P$ requires a function of one point) and the resultant function called $G^{*}\left(p_{2}\right)$.

This function can then be used to determine the elements of the 4x4 block representing this patch's interaction with itself (see Circular Integration section 6.1 in appendix \ref{chap:circular_integration}):

\begin{equation}
  K_{1}=P\left(G^{*},p\right)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  K_{2}=P\left(G^{*}x_{p},p\right)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  K_{3}=P\left(G^{*}y_{p},p\right)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  K_{4}=P\left(G^{*}x_{p}y_{p},p\right)
\end{equation}

One row of the 4x4 block is thus:

\begin{equation}
  Z_{s,s'}=\frac{K_{1}}{4}+\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2a}\left(-K_{2}-K_{3}\right)+\frac{3}{a^{2}}K_{4}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  Z_{s,s'+1}=\frac{K_{1}}{4}+\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2a}\left(-K_{2}+K_{3}\right)-\frac{3}{a^{2}}K_{4}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  Z_{s,s'+2}=\frac{K_{1}}{4}+\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2a}\left(K_{2}+K_{3}\right)+\frac{3}{a^{2}}K_{4}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  Z_{s,s'+3}=\frac{K_{1}}{4}+\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2a}\left(K_{2}-K_{3}\right)-\frac{3}{a^{2}}K_{4}
\end{equation}

\ldots where $s$ is the index of this point ($p$) and $s'$ is the first index of the other point.

% REFLECTANCE %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Surface Current} \label{sec:current}

Since $Z \space E = J$ (where $Z$ is the impedance matrix, $E$ is a vector of the electric field at each point on the mirror, and $J$ is the surface current at each point), once $Z$ and $E$ are determined $J$ can be computed as $Z^{-1} \space E$. See Circular Integration section 6 (appendix \ref{chap:circular_integration}).



\section{Reflectance} \label{sec:reflectance}

Given $J$, reflectance for a given $\theta$ (polar) and $\phi$ (azimuthal) is determined by:

\begin{equation}
  R=\sum_{pts}J_{pt}e^{-ik\left(x\sin\left(\theta\right)\cos\left(\phi\right)+y\sin\left(\theta\right)\cos\left(\phi\right)+z\cos\left(\theta\right)\right)}
\end{equation}

The real part squared yields the intensity at infinity at the given angle.

% CODE %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{The Code}\label{sec:code}

The Julia package \href{https://github.com/mjg0/Mirrors.jl}{Mirrors.jl} (which is included as appendix \ref{chap:julia}) was built and used for computation. Here's an example of its usage:

\begin{minted}{julia}
  using Mirrors, Plots

  # Create a Mirror object
  radius = 2.5 # units are wavelengths
  N = 20       # number of rings
  rms = 0.0    # RMS of surface roughness (wavelengths)
  sigma = 0.0  # stdev of surface roughness (wavelengths)
  M = Mirror(radius, N, rms, sigma)

  # Find the mirror's impedance
  Z = impedance(M)

  # Find the electric field induced by a uniform plane wave
  alpha = pi/8 # incident beam angle
  E = electricfield(M, alpha)

  # Find the surface current due to E
  J = Z \ E

  # Determine and plot reflectance
  R = Reflectance(M, J)
  heatmap(R)
\end{minted}

The resultant heatmap, with a few extra parameters for the \texttt{heatmap} call (see appendix \ref{chap:heatmap_code}), might look like figure \ref{fig:sample_heatmap}.

\begin{figure}
  \centerline{\includegraphics[width=.7\textwidth]{sample-reflectance}}
  \centerline{\includegraphics[width=.7\textwidth]{sample-reflectance-expected}}
  \caption[heatmap from the above sample code]{\label{fig:sample_heatmap}
    A heatmap of the reflectance found by the sample code in section \ref{sec:code} plotted along with expected reflectance (calculated reflectance on top, expected reflectance on bottom). As mentioned in section \ref{sec:plots_note}, it is an azimuthal equidistant projection of the far field reflectance centered normal to the mirror and extending 90 degrees in any direction.}
\end{figure}



\subsection{Validation} \label{sec:validation}

To ensure that the code works correctly, tests were written to ensure that any function can be integrated over the surface. The full tests are included in appendix \ref{runtests.jl}.

An impedance matrix can be created for an arbitrary function, not just Green's function (equation \ref{eq:greens}). For example, to use the equation $f\left(r, \theta\right) = r^2$ for mirror \texttt{M}, one can create the impedance matrix thus:

\begin{minted}{julia}
  Z = impedance(M, (r1, θ1, z1, r2, θ2, z2)->r2^2)
\end{minted}

Since the function used to generate the impedance matrix is in this case a function of only one point, each cell is simply the integral of that function over the portion of the mirror represented by the point corresponding to the column the cell occurs in. This means that the sum of a each row of the matrix should equal the integral of the function over the entire surface.

The 4x4 blocks along the main diagonal representing the self-interaction of each patch (see section \ref{sec:impedance}) are similarly constrained: although the method of calculation differs, one row of such a 4x4 block should still sum to the integral of the function over the patch.

Both sums of full rows and the sums of rows of the singular patch blocks are tested against the equations:

$f\left(r, \theta\right) = 0.7$

$f\left(r, \theta\right) = r$

$f\left(r, \theta\right) = 1.4 r \sin\left(\theta\right)^2$

$f\left(r, \theta\right) = 0.3 r^2 \cos\left(\theta\right)^2$

\ldots and in each case is correct to within 1\% for every row of the impedance matrix with mirrors of 3 rings (so few are used so the tests, of which this is just a part, can be run reasonably fast); the integral is in all cases within 0.01\% of the sum calculated from the singular blocks.

% RESULTS %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\chapter{Results}\label{chap:results}

A mirror and its corresponding electric field, impedance matrix, surface current, and reflectance were calculated and plotted for every combination of the following values:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Mirror radius: 3, 10, and 30 wavelengths
  \item Mirror roughness RMS height: 0, 0.01, and 0.1 wavelengths
  \item Mirror roughness standard deviation: 1, 3, and 10 wavelengths
  \item Incident light angle, from normal (degrees): 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75
  \item Gaussian beam cross section standard deviation: uniform beam, 1, 3, and 10 wavelengths
\end{itemize}

Mirror roughness was generated by creating a random surface then applying a Gaussian blur image filter to that surface. The standard deviation mentioned is the standard deviation of the blur filter--higher standard deviations result in a smoother, more rolling surface. After the application of the blur filter, the values of the mirror were shifted to average zero, then the height of each point scaled such that the RMS height of the mirror was as mentioned.

A "Gaussian beam" here refers to a beam of light with a radial Gaussian intensity distribution centered on the middle of the mirror.

Since mirrors that fit in the memory of a personal computer yielded poor results (see figure \ref{fig:sample_heatmap}), the largest mirror size that can fit on non-exotic supercomputer nodes was chosen: 100 rings. This gives an impedance matrix of just over 230 GB with double precision complex floats, allowing the simulation to just fit in 500 GB of memory when taking the preconditioner for the solver into account.

Not a single simulation yielded credible results, even those involving smooth mirrors. Figure \ref{fig:100_rings} shows a representative example.

\begin{figure}
  \centerline{\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{100-ring-results}}
  \caption[Results with 100 rings]{\label{fig:100_rings}
    Results given a mirror with 100 rings, a radius of 10 wavelengths, roughness with a standard deviation of 3 wavelengths and an RMS height of 0.01 wavelengths, and a uniform illuminating light beam emanating from 30 degrees from normal. "Mirror" shows the height of the surface, with the pink and cyan dots and their labels indicating the highest and lowest points on the mirror; units are wavelengths. "Electric Field" and "Surface Current" are mapped on the mirror's surface; white represents zero, blue represents negative values, and red represents positive values. "Reflectance", as mentioned in section \ref{sec:plots_note}, is an azimuthal polar equidistant projection plot of reflectance centered at normal to the mirror's surface and extending to grazing, with deeper reds representing higher intensities and white representing zero.}
\end{figure}

Using more rings made very little difference. Figure [\ref{fig:30_rings}] shows the results of a simulation with identical parameters, save that 30 rings were used instead of 100.

\begin{figure}
  \centerline{\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{30-ring-results}}
  \caption[Results with 30 rings]{\label{fig:30_rings}
    Results with 30 rings. Conventions are identical to those of figure \ref{fig:100_rings}.}
\end{figure}

It seems likely that the results are poor due to the poor conditioning of the impedance matrices: for the simulation mentioned above, the condition numbers were 85.2 billion with 100 rings (figure \ref{fig:100_rings}) and 1.43 billion with 30 rings (figure \ref{fig:30_rings}), destroying the credibility of the solutions even if they did look right \cite{KincaidCheney}.
